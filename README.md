## Introduction

This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for learning and practicing data structures and algorithms. It's designed to provide you with hands-on experience through labs and projects while also offering explanations and implementations of various data structures and algorithms.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `data_structures/`: This directory contains implementations and explanations of various data structures. Each data structure is contained in its own subdirectory and includes source code, explanations, and usage examples.

- `algorithms/`: Here, you'll find implementations of various algorithms. Each algorithm has its own subdirectory containing source code, explanations, and examples of its application.

- `labs/`: This directory contains a series of lab exercises designed to reinforce your understanding of data structures and algorithms. Each lab includes a description of the problem, starter code, and a README on how to approach the problem.

- `projects/`: In this directory, you'll find more extensive projects that involve multiple data structures and algorithms. These projects are designed to give you a deeper understanding of how to apply what you've learned to real-world scenarios.

## Data Structures

Explore different data structures in the `data_structures/` directory, including:
- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, etc.)
- Heaps

Each data structure subdirectory contains its own README with explanations, use cases, and example code.

## Algorithms

Discover a variety of algorithms in the `algorithms/` directory, such as:

- Sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
- Searching algorithms (Binary Search, Linear Search, etc.)
- Graph algorithms (Breadth-First Search, Dijkstra's Algorithm, etc.)
- Dynamic Programming algorithms
- Recursion and Backtracking algorithms

Each algorithm subdirectory includes explanations, pseudocode, and actual code implementations.

## Labs

The `labs/` directory contains a series of hands-on lab exercises. Each lab provides a problem statement, starter code, and guidelines on solving the problem using the concepts covered in the repository.

## Projects

In the `projects/` directory, you'll find more extensive projects that require you to apply multiple data structures and algorithms to solve real-world problems. Each project comes with a detailed description, requirements, and suggested approaches.

Happy coding!
